       <p>In Free Fire, players control a character in a third-person perspective. The fire button allows them to shoot and throw items.  <br>The character can perform actions such as jumping, crawling, and lying down. During gameplay, players can utilize the "Gloo Wall" grenade as a form of cover to protect against damage</p>
    <b><h2>Game modes</h2></b>
    <p>Free Fire offers over 15 game modes, including Team Deathmatch, Clash Squad, Big Head, Explosive Jump, Cold Steel, Zombie Hunt, Rampage, and Pet Mania.  <br>However, modes other than Battle Royale, Clash Squad, and Lone Wolf are only available during special events.</p>
    <b><h2>Battle Royale</h2></b>
    <p>The Battle Royale mode in Free Fire accommodates up to 52 players landing on an island without weapons. <br> They must fight to be the last one standing by scavenging weapons and equipment from buildings. Playing this mode in ranked mode will affect their ranking. <br> There are 6 maps to choose from: Bermuda, Bermuda Remastered, Kalahari, Purgatory, Alpine, and NeXTerra. The mode allows for solo, duo, or squad play.</p>
    <b><h2>Clash Squad</h2></b>
    <p>Clash Squad is a 4-player versus 4-player mode where players purchase weapons and items from an in-game shop during preparation time, then engage in combat against the opposing team. <br> The mode is played in a best-of-7 format, lasting anywhere from 4 to 7 rounds. Each round is won when all players from one team are killed, either by their opponents or through environmental factors. <br> As of 2022, the maps used in Clash Squad are the same as those in Battle Royale mode. The mode can be played as either Ranked or Casual.</p>
    <p>Craftland allows players to design their own maps in Free Fire using an in-game builder tool. The maps created can be shared and played with others. Craftland also supports script editing for advanced customization, giving creators greater freedom to bring their ideas to life. <br> Players can add buildings, gameplay elements, and decorations to the map until they reach the maximum space limit. There are two maps available for players to use as the base for their designs.</p>

     <b><h2>Character system</h2></p>
    <p>Free Fire features a character system of 50+ characters. Each character has a unique skill which can be active or passive.

Each character can equip 4 skills including the character's skill and 3 skills from other characters (one active skill and three passive skills can be equipped by a single character).Free Fire characters have unique backstories. A few of these characters were inspired by real-life celebrities whom Free Fire had collaborations with, such as Chrono from the collaboration with Cristiano Ronaldo, Dimitri & Thiva from the collaboration with Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, A-Patroa from the collaboration with Anitta, Alok from the collaboration with DJ Alok and JBeibs from the collaboration with Justin Bieber. In the game, it is possible to acquire all characters by using gold, an in-game currency that can be earned through gameplay and event participation, or with Diamonds which can be bought with real-world currency.</p>

Players can also customize their pets with skins and emotes.</p>
     <b><h2>Ranking System</h2></b>
    <p>Ranking System In Free Fire, a seven-tier ranking system, including sub-tiers like Bronze I, II, III, categorizes players by skill and performance. <br> Players earn ranking points based on kills, damage, survival time and standing position, progressing from Bronze to Grandmaster. <br> Seasons reset ranks (e.g., from Silver III to Bronze I or II). There are two ranked modes: Battle Royale rank mode and Clash Squad rank mode</p>
    <b><h2>Reception</h2></b>
    <p>The graphics were described as having "a benefit for mid- and low-specification phones", but a reviewer stated that "if games with good graphics are your thing then we don't recommend that you play Free Fire Battlegrounds. But if you like battle royale games and want to have fun with your friends, you should definitely play."  
    Tais Carvalho of Techtudo commented that Free Fire "prioritizes performance, making it a great choice for any type of device. The gameplay stands out and has enough content to entertain and offer rewarding combat." Regarding the progression of characters and skills, she said it is "a flashy add-on".
